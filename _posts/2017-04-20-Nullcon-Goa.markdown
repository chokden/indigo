This time the Nullcon conference venue was Holiday Inn Resort in Cavelossim. 
It was my 2nd Nullcon conference and I had more fun than the last time. 
One interesting  fact about Cavelossim district is that they have a village named Tibet with local goan people. 
To this day I dont know what **Tibet** means in Konkani, I shall make it my mission to find out about it.
I reached my hotel around 9 pm but I was too tired to attend the remaining talks at the event.

## Day 1.

I hurried to the registration counter to get my ID for the event. First person I see at the event is
Antriksh, I waved my hands to him; he smiled and disappeared in the crowd.
I was excited to meet my friend "The laughing German Buddha", I went ahead to attend the Keynote by Joshua Pennel.
In many ways we do neglect the security aspects of hardware and focus more on the software. The industry has created a
benchmark for reviewing software but not in terms of hardware components which should be on the same level of software.

When Josh started talking about Jtag, the first thing that came to my mind was XBOX 360 and the process involved in
jtagging it. JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is an industry standard established technology used mainly for connection
testing and in system programming (ISP). You can read more about it here [Jtag](https://goo.gl/rf0ycy)

Next time if you see something weird on a hardware component: "Fire up your IDA Pro and start fuzzing".

    <p> The last time I met Joerg was at Nullcon 2015, its rare to see a German who laughs and smiles often; so when you meet one
        you have to make the best of it :D I met Fabian Affolter when he visited Dharamsala in 2013 and we worked on
        localization and it was nice to see him again at Nullcon. We went to the lobby to catch up on things we have missed since
        the last time, apparently we talked more about our personal life than security which could be a surprise to muggles since they
        think all we talk is binary.

     Joerg Simon introduced me to the Fedora community back in 2015 where I gave a talk on <a href='http://tenzinchokden.com/fedora-community-and-fudcon-pune'> Achieving Communit Goals with Fedora </a> at Fudcon APAC Pune. The community has been welcoming since 
     and its great to be part of the family.

    Joerg and I tried to find guys from the Redhat but they remained as ghost till end of Nullcon.
    I also attended the talk Great Bugs in Google VRP by Karshan Sharma which ended with a free Google swag.</p>

    <p>This year the Nullcon networking party started early, I participated in the drum challenge and it was really fun playing
    along with the instructor. Joerg, Harish and I had a good time over a glass of wine, too bad Joerg couldn't get a soda pop. 
    The party ended around 11 pm with half the people going to the beach to get drowned, just kidding; everyone went home. </p>

## Day2.

I think it is becoming a tradition for me get sick on the second day of every conference I attend. I met Joerg again after
lunch and attended the talk by Karen Sittig on *Better Security at Facebook*. 


I was reading PJP's blog few days earlieri about *how do we grow Fedora community across APAC*, so I decided to ask people in the conference about their default OS
and why they choose it. As expected, most of them were introduced to linux by ubuntu and how user friendly it is. Second,
being the number of custom packages already available either in ubuntu repository or ppa, changing OS is often difficult;
its human nature. I think the ambassadors role in how Fedora is introduced to its community will have significant impact
on the user base. Considering the interest of users and then introducing Fedora as means to achieve their goal along with
teaching them how to be contributors and package maintainers would help in retaining the user base active and eventually
grow. I had some feedback from the developers I met in the event, I would love to participate in the next FAD to discuss
the issue or maybe I will host one FAD-DH (Dharamsala) sounds cool anyway :D.

 I attended the *Next gen threat detection using AI*, but in the middle of the talk Microsoft was trying to product
 pitch its telemetry and analytics feature in their upcoming product. Ajit Hatti called me on stage to unravel the mystery
 of who will won the drone by picking from the lottery. 

 It was Antrikshs birthday but he already was already exhausted from the event.

 I'd like to thank Fedora Project and Joerg for making it sure that I attend Nullcon. It was yet another great experience;
 looking forward to attend again :D.
