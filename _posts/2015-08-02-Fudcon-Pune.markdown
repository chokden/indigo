**July 2013** when Joerg Simon and Fabian Affolter introduced Fedora localization and the OSSTMM to Central Tibetan Administration, I saw Joerg using fedora kde and thought it was cool. I tried fedora butI went back to using ubuntu since all my colleagues were using it and troubleshooting easier. Joergs interest in tibetan thangka gave us good time hunting for the best thangka painting in town. Finally we got “Manjushri” - the Boddhisatva of Wisdom. 

I met him again during Nullcon 2015, during which he introduced me to Praveen Kumar and knew about fudcon in 2015. Joerg guided me throughout the fudcon procedure, although i was intimidated at submitting a paper at fudcon. I also met Harish Pillay again, he is a cheerful and warm hearted person who knows and wants to help about the tibetan community.

So my journey began for Fudcon Pune 2015, I thought fudcon will be like any other conference where I will present my talk, meet new people. Little did I know that the F in fedora also stands for Family :D


## Day 0 Midnight

Door bell rings ... 
It was Aditya patawari, apparently he seemed confused that i am his room mate. I guess he was expecting someone else. He went off with the bell boy looking
confused ...
The bell rang again and this time he was sure i am his room mate. We exchanged a quick greetings of “hi hello” followed by our name and went to sleep.


## Day 1

They first person I met in the morning was Harish, I met him during nullcon goa and it felt great to see him again. Kushal started distributing the Fedora merchandize and then we headed to the venue MIT Pune.

Since this was my first time in the fedora community, I didnt know anybody and was excited in meeting new people.
I met Danishka, Sirko, Yogi and  Brendon who gave me a pair of fedora sticker for my thinkpad.
I met swapnil who was in hill hacks few weeks back in Mcleod Ganj and quickly our converstaion grew, making me feel less intimidated of fudcon.  Harish and I catched up on our life since the last time we met. 
Later that night Aditya patawari invited me for the mini fudpub but I couldn't go as I was not feeling well with migraine.


## Day 2

My keynote was at the end of the day, so I thought of attending various other talks. Kernel and userspace tracing with LTTng by Suchakra was a very interesting session, and I couldn't resist asking him for linux performance observability tool chart. 

Pravin's talk on nuts and bolts of fedora internationalization and globalization was the talk I was looking for. I wanted to localize  whole fedora operating system in tibetan language and his talk gave me a number of new ideas to implement. After lunch I just sat in the Auditorium brushing my presentaion and enjoying the talks going on.

I began my keynote by asking how many in the audience know about Tibetans in India. There were quite few who knew about the community and  have been to the places. I was very happy when Kiran said he has been to Dharamsala and visited hillhacks and he knew about my community.

After my keynote, I got a very good response from the audience who are willing to help in localizing Tibetan language in fedora. I was overwhelmed by the feedback i received from the audience .

From Fudcon venue to bluO in Phoenix MarketCity where the actual Fudpub was happening i shared 2 hours bus ride with kushal das.
To be honest, he looked intimidating and serious to me first. But those 2 hours of conversation with him chagned everything. Kushal was a tibetan food lover, spicy thukpa to be specific. He told me, he wanted to visit my hometown and i was happy to have him as my guest at home. Kushals interest in collecting buddha statue even got me closer to him as friend.

At Fudpub i met Truong, my first impression was OMG!!! There is a chinese person in the audience. Even i know that FOSS and Fedora is neutral ground to bring us all together - i was a bit hesitent to talk to him and my first question before even introducing was “are you chinese ...”? To my surprise he said, NO i am
Vietnamise! We both laughed when he said that, and we had a great time together. Izhar joined us and all of us had great fun at the fud pub. The food was good and the people were cheerful. I had a great time bowling with Jens Peterson; we both had good number of strikes but he won :D

## Day 3

I couldn't attend key signing party, for some reason the morning weather was triggering my dizzyness and headache. I quickly exchange my keys with friends I have met during the fudcon.
Closing note from Rupali was very good and it showed how every one in the community worked hard to make it a success and I was happy to be a part of the community. To me it felt like a large family always ready to accept new members and i felt great being a part of it.
A Group of us  went for a shopping and on our way we went to the Tibetan market in Pune called the fashion street where i pretended to be someone from Indonesia. We met an old lady who after finding out i was an imposter asked me why I came all the way from north India to Pune.
She was very happy when I told her about my purpose of visit and how everyone in the group is a supporter for Tibetan people and its cause.

At dinner, Kushals rant on the Tom yum soup was funniest moment of the night. I headed to Kirans room where they were editing the videos of the talk.
Kushal joined us and started cracking jokes from this mysterious guy name ramkey. We had such a good time at Kirans room that night , followed by me finding out Ratnadweep and Sayan chowdhary are anime lovers. This day couldn't have been better. We exchanged our contacts and had our own rants on the spoilers during the anime episodes.


## Day 4

I had lunch at kushals place and found out his wife was also interested in Tibetan food and its culture, I kept thingking they should have a Tibetan name :D
I missed my chance of visiting Redhat office in Pune since I slept in the morning, but it was a conference to remember and I look forward to attend next year :D
As I was leaving the hotel, I asked Kushal it would be nice to have f in the fedora for family. He responded saying F does stands for family and fedora infact was founded by a group of friends.

As I promised in my keynote, I am proudly using Fedora for my personal as well as work. I even get my dad to use Fedora. :D
